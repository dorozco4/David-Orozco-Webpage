MY WEBPAGE 

Hey, as you can tell this is my very first attempt at a personal webpage,
I decided to go with a clean, minimalistic, and easy to navigate look. 
The about me section is still currently under development as you can see, 
and I do plan on improving it as the time goes by and I understand how to code 
better and apply more of the skills that we are going to learn into it.

I will say that for what we have learned the past three weeks I was able to 
put all of the skills to use and had a great time doing and making the webpage 
exaclty how I wanted it to look.

With that being said My Webpage is still in progress and looking forward to putting the 
skills and techniques we will be learning in class to use.

Thank you,
David Orozco
